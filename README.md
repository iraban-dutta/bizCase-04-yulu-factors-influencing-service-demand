Yulu is Indiaâ€™s leading micro-mobility service provider, which offers unique vehicles for the daily commute. Yulu zones are located at all the appropriate locations (including metro stations, bus stands, office spaces, residential areas, corporate offices, etc) to make those first and last miles smooth, affordable, and convenient!
Yulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues and want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market.
